# CoordFinder2
###### This is the JS App using the three.js library to build a 3D scene.  

1. Setup web pack dev server: [a good example](https://imranhsayed.medium.com/webpack-dev-server-b1010d01dba5).

2. To install the three.js library with npm do: `npm install three` and `npm install three-orbitcontrols`

3. To run the server: `npm run dev`

4. Then go to: `http://localhost:8080/`

###### Why this app:

I created this application for the possibility in the future of creating a three-dimensional scene with real objects in real proportions.  At the moment, this is only a model that demonstrates the elements of creating and deleting objects on a plane, calculating coordinates by moving the cursor and calculating the lengths of segments. In addition, the area of the drawn triangles is also calculated.

###### What this app have and what it can do:

1. A 3D-scene with objects, axis and light

2. The user can see in real time the change in the coordinates of the plane, depending on the movement along it with the mouse cursor

3. You can draw and delete objects on the plane (spheres, lines, triangles)

4. You can see the real-time measured length of the line segments drawn on the plane

5. You can see the real-time measured area of the triangles drawn on the plane
