# JS-Coord-Finder

###### This JS application uses the three.js library to build a 3D scene.

###### Why this app is awesome:

I created this application to potentially create three-dimensional scenes with real objects in real proportions in the future. Currently, it is a model that demonstrates elements of creating and deleting objects on a plane, calculating coordinates by moving the cursor, and calculating the lengths of segments. Additionally, the area of the drawn triangles is also calculated.

###### What this app can do:

1. Create a 3D scene with objects, axes, and lighting.
2. Users can see real-time changes in plane coordinates as they move the mouse cursor.
3. You can draw and delete objects on the plane (spheres, lines, triangles).
4. You can see the real-time measured length of line segments drawn on the plane.
5. You can see the real-time measured area of triangles drawn on the plane.
